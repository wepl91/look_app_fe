# Mercurio
> Shipnow's Design System implemented in React

## Getting Started

Run the following command using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

### Running the library for development

Run the following command to start Storybook for component display and test:

```bash
cd shipnow-mercurio
npm start
```

### Using the library locally

First, you need to link Mercurio to your local node_modules npm repository. 

```bash
cd shipnow-mercurio
npm link
```

The command will build the library for distribution with [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/), copy the resulting folder in the local node_modules folder, and make it available for other local projects. 

```bash
cd your-project-folder
npm link shipnow-mercurio
```

You'll need to manually install [React JSS](http://cssinjs.org/react-jss/):

```bash
npm install --save react-jss
```

React JSS is mandatory for the use of theming. Then, in your app, you can use it like this:

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Title, DefaultTheme } from 'shipnow-mercurio';
import { ThemeProvider } from 'react-jss';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <ThemeProvider theme={DefaultTheme}>
        <Title>Hola mundo!</Title>
      </ThemeProvider>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

Note that ReactJSS and ThemeProvider only need to be used once, at the top of your app. Then inner components will get the active theme by context.
